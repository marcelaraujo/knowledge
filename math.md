## Eigenvector
> In linear algebra, an eigenvector or characteristic vector of a square matrix
> is a vector that points in a direction which is invariant under the associated
> linear transformation. In other words, if v is a vector which is not zero, then
> it is an eigenvector of a square matrix A if Av is a scalar multiple of v.
